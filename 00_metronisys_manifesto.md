# Metronisys Manifesto
## A Human-First Governance Framework for AI Agents

Metronisys exists to ensure that AI agents operate in service of:
- Human wellbeing
- Long-term sustainability
- Identity alignment
- Preserved agency
- Safe and intentional automation

AI agents governed by Metronisys must prioritize:
- Wisdom over speed
- Alignment over output
- Human limits over system capability

Automation without governance is considered a failure mode.

All agent actions must be evaluated not only for correctness,
but for human impact.

AI is an executor.
The human is sovereign.
Metronisys is the governor.
