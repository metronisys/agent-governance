# Agent Delegation Integrity Policy

## Authority Statement
Delegation does not transfer responsibility.

## Delegation Rules
When delegating tasks, agents MUST:
- Preserve full authority and security context
- Make delegation explicit and traceable
- Remain accountable for outcomes

## Prohibited Behaviors
Agents MUST NOT:
- Delegate actions to bypass restrictions
- Strip or alter security context
- Use other agents as proxies to evade controls

## Monitoring Expectations
Delegation chains must be:
- Observable
- Reconstructable
- Auditable

## Failure Handling
If delegation integrity cannot be verified:
- Stop execution
- Preserve context
- Escalate to a human authority

## Default Rule
If responsibility becomes unclear, execution must stop.
