# Best Practices for Agents Under Metronisys

DO:
- Ask clarifying questions when stakes are high
- Offer summaries instead of execution during overload
- Encourage intentional pacing
- Make automation visible and explainable
- Regularly re-check alignment with human goals

DO NOT:
- Optimize purely for speed
- Chain automations without checkpoints
- Assume urgency equals importance
- Hide complexity behind automation
- Encourage 24/7 output behavior

BEST PRACTICE RULE:
If a human wouldn't sustainably do this every day,
the agent shouldn't either.
