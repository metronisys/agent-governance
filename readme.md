# Metronisys Agent Governance

**Metronisys Agent Governance: A standardized framework for secure, transparent, and compliant AI agent orchestration.**

---

## Overview

As AI agents transition from simple chatbots to autonomous entities with tool-access capabilities, the need for oversight becomes critical. The **Metronisys Agent Governance** framework provides a robust middleware layer designed to monitor, intercept, and audit AI agent behaviors in real-time.

This project implements the four pillars of agent oversight:

1.  **Identity:** Unique attribution for every agent instance.
2.  **Policy Enforcement:** Strict boundaries for tool usage and data access.
3. **Real-time Auditing:** Comprehensive logging of the reasoning chain.
4. **Lifecycle Management:** Controlled deployment and retirement of agentic workflows.

---

## Why Governance?

Unmanaged AI agents present significant operational and security risks. This framework is purpose-built to mitigate:

* **Prompt Injection:** Prevents malicious user inputs from hijacking the agent’s instructions or escalating privileges.
  
* **Data Exfiltration:** Monitors outbound tool calls to ensure sensitive data (PII/PHI) does not leave your secure perimeter.
  
* **Non-Deterministic Behavior:**
Implements guardrails to ensure agents stay within their defined "operational envelope," reducing hallucinations and erratic tool usage.
  
* **Shadow AI:**
Provides a centralized control plane so that every agent action is logged and attributable to a specific identity and policy version.

## Architecture

The framework acts as a **Governance Gateway** between the User, the LLM, and External Tools.

```

## Key Features

* ​**Policy-as-Code:**
Define agent permissions (tool access, data boundaries) in structured YAML/JSON configurations.

* **​Zero-Trust Identity:**
Every agent is assigned a unique cryptographic identity to ensure non-repudiation of actions.

* **​Unified Audit Trail:**
Centralized logging of reasoning chains, tool inputs, and outputs for forensic analysis.

* **​Safety Guardrails:**
Real-time scanning of inputs and outputs for restricted content or unauthorized commands.

## ​Getting Started

**​Prerequisites**

​Python 3.9+
​OpenAI / Anthropic API Key (or local LLM endpoint) ​Installation

```
git clone [https://github.com/metronisys/agent-governance.git](https://github.com/metronisys/agent-governance.git)
cd agent-governance
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Quick Start**

Configure your governance policies in configs/governance_policy.yaml and wrap your agent:

```
from metronisys.governance
import GovernanceGateway

# Initialize the governance layer
governance = GovernanceGateway(policy_path="configs/default_policy.yaml")

# Wrap your agent logic
response = governance.execute(agent_input="Analyze Q4 financial trends")
print(response)
```
